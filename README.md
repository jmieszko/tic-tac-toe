Approach
For the UI, the goal was to keep it as simple as possible on a canvas that would fit a PC monitor as well as an iPhone XS without the need to scroll.
The game tiles are large enough to either tap or click.
A message box at the top of the board would change to the color of the current user's term.  If a game is not in progress, then a message would state to click on a new game.
